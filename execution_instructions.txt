program execution pipeline:

1. make_breakpoint_regions.rb -f "lff annotations file of breakpoint regions (two regions per breakpoint)"

    see program descriptions and internal program comments for additional execution conditions.

2. if make_breakpoint_regions.rb was run using both repeat masked and non-repeat masked genomes, 
    these seperate output files should be concatenated into a single breakpoint regions file
    before running primer3.

3. make_p3cmd.rb -b "breakpoint region files .txt"

    program assumes "primer3_core" is an executable Primer3 command on current system

4. make_isPCR.rb -b "Primer3 output file .raw"

    Runs inSilico PCR on the Primer3 primer designs, keeps only those passing primer designs
    that do not produce an amplicon within the expected breakpoint size range when applied to 
    the normal genome. Generates .lff files of the primer design set, one set for each breakpoint.

    program assumes "isPcr" is an executable command on current system
