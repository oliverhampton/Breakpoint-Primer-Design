program execution pipeline:

Note: Primer Design parameters are currently set for Sanger-based sequenicng on the Illumina ABI 3730XL instrument

1. make_breakpoint_regions.rb -f "lff annotations file of breakpoint regions (two regions per breakpoint)"
   makes the sequence region specified by the input .lff file for each breakpoint required as Primer3 input 

 example:
   make_breakpoint_regions.rb 
      -f nextera_breakpoint_calls.lff
      -r /genome_reference/hg19/masked/oneLineSeq/ || /genome_reference/hg19/unmasked/oneLineSeq/
      -l RepeatMasked || NonRepeatMasked
      -t 20
      -s 1000

2. It is recommeded to execute make_breakpoint_regions.rb using both the repeat masked and non-repeat masked genomes (see item 1), 
   then these two seperate output files should be concatenated into a single breakpoint regions file before running primer3.

 example:
   cat nextera_breakpoint_calls.lff_RepeatMasked_regions.txt nextera_breakpoint_calls.lff_NonRepeatMasked_regions.txt > nextera_breakpoint_regions.txt

3. make_p3cmd.rb -b "breakpoint region files .txt"

   execute Primer3 on the concatenated breakpoint regions from Masked and Unmasked genome references. 
   Assumes Primer3 Version 2.3.5 or higher.

 example:
   make_p3cmd.rb -b nextera_breakpoint_regions.txt

4. make_isPCR.rb -b "Primer3 output file .raw"

    Runs inSilico PCR on the Primer3 primer designs, keeps only those passing primer designs
    that do not produce an amplicon within the expected breakpoint size range when applied to 
    the normal genome. Generates .lff files of the primer design set, one set for each breakpoint.

 example:
   make_isPCR.rb -b nextera_breakpoint_regions_p3cmd_primer3.raw -r /genome_reference/hg19/unmasked/ -s 1000 -m 4000 -l RepeatMasked
